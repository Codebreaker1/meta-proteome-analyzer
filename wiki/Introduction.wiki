== Introduction ==
MetaProteomeAnalyzer (MPA) is a stand-alone platform-independent application written in Java and developed at [http://www.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de Max Planck Institute for Dynamics of Complex Technical Systems Magdeburg/Germany].

The software provides an easy-to-use graphical user interface for processing and interpretation of tandem mass spectrometric (MS/MS) metaproteomics data. 

The basic spectrum input format for MetaProteomeAnalyzer is the MASCOT Generic Format (MGF). MGF files are generated by most common mass spectrometric software applications. 

*Note:* In case of not having access to the MGF file format (e.g. RAW format only), please have a look at the [http://proteowizard.sourceforge.net ProteoWizard toolsuite] for conversion of MS/MS spectra.

The software is being maintained by
